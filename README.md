This is the *Battleship with Java* project I made myself.

In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Place and arrange all the ships on the game field by working with multidimensional arrays
- Player to arrange ships, hide them behind the fog of war, and fire at a random position demonstrating handling user input.
- Denote the conditions for the end of the game demonstrating working with conditional statement.
- Make the game more interesting by adding another player feature.
- Using lambda and streams
